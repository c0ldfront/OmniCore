# OmniCore

OmniCore is an Android app for controlling the Omnipod insulin pump (i.e. the "Pod"s).

It implements the full functionality of the PDM (Personal Diabetes Manager). It also allows you to [close the loop](https://openaps.org/) for insulin delivery using your omnipod; currently integrated into a [customized version of Android APS](https://github.com/winemug/AndroidAPS).

The app is currently NOT released.

~~Beta testing will begin on Wednesday, May 29th 2019~~

Due to personal time constraints and a couple of Android related hiccups I had to delay the beta release about a week.

The first functional beta is currently planned for release on **Monday, June 3rd.** and will be announced here. First major version and the stable release will be created earliest a week after the first beta release, depending on the results of beta testing.

You can follow the progress more closely [here](https://github.com/winemug/OmniCore/projects/1).

Note: OmniCore currently does NOT support Omnipod Dash and can be used for Omnipod Eros only. See [roadmap](https://github.com/winemug/OmniCore/wiki/Roadmap).

OmniCore is the follow-up project to [OmniPy](https://github.com/winemug/omnipy)
